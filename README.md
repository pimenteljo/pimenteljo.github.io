# Data Science and Analytics Projects

This repository contains a collection of **data science and analytics projects** I have worked on, both academic and personal, during my journey at the University of Pennsylvania. These projects showcase my skills in data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and spatial analysis. My passion for combining data science with social impact is reflected in both my academic and personal endeavors.

## Projects

### 1. **Capital Punishment Statute Research**
   **Duration**: September 2024 - Present  
   **Technologies Used**: R (Exploratory Data Analysis, Time Series, Chi-Square Test, Regression)  
   **Overview**: This project analyzes Florida capital punishment statutes to explore death penalty sentencing trends. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, chi-square tests, and regression techniques to assess the impact of capital punishment laws on sentencing patterns. The research aims to provide insights into legal frameworks and influence future policy decisions.

## Files
- [Florida_CP_Analysis.R](Florida_CP_Analysis.R): R script that performs the analysis.
- [Pimentel, Jocelyn - Capital Punishment Research Proposal.pdf](Pimentel, Jocelyn - Capital Punishment Research Proposal.pdf): The research paper outlining the study, methodology, and results (if available).



### 2. **Geospatial Analysis of Philadelphia ACS Data**
   **Duration**: September - December 2024  
   **Technologies Used**: ArcGIS Pro (spatial analysis, mapping), R  
   **Overview**:  
   Utilized ArcGIS Pro for spatial joins, attribute queries, and buffering analyses. The project assessed population trends and urban planning impacts, creating thematic maps, visualizations, and time-series animations of crime data.

### 3. **Data and Analysis for Marketing Decisions**
   **Duration**: October 2024  
   **Technologies Used**: R (classification models, ggplot2)  
   **Overview**:  
   Applied classification models to predict customer behavior and retention rates. Designed ggplot2 visualizations to present insights on improving customer engagement and reducing churn.

### 4. **Analyzing Wrongful Conviction Trends in the Northeast**
   **Duration**: January 2022 - May 2024  
   **Technologies Used**: R (data cleaning, statistical modeling, data visualization)  
   **Overview**:  
   Cleaned and transformed the National Registry of Exonerations dataset. Applied statistical models in RStudio and created visualizations to inform policy recommendations on wrongful convictions.
