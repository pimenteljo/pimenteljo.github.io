# Data Science and Analytics Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science and analytics projects I have worked on during my academic journey at the University of Pennsylvania. These projects showcase my skills in data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and spatial analysis.

## Projects

### 1. **Capital Punishment Statute Research**
   **Duration**: September 2024 - Present  
   **Technologies Used**: R (time series analysis, regression)  
   **Overview**:  
   Analyzed jury statutes and death penalty sentencing trends using R. Conducted time series and regression analyses to support academic research and influence legal decision-making.

### 2. **Geospatial Analysis of Philadelphia ACS Data**
   **Duration**: September - December 2024  
   **Technologies Used**: ArcGIS Pro (spatial analysis, mapping), R  
   **Overview**:  
   Utilized ArcGIS Pro for spatial joins, attribute queries, and buffering analyses. The project assessed population trends and urban planning impacts, creating thematic maps, visualizations, and time-series animations of crime data.

### 3. **Data and Analysis for Marketing Decisions**
   **Duration**: October 2024  
   **Technologies Used**: R (classification models, ggplot2)  
   **Overview**:  
   Applied classification models to predict customer behavior and retention rates. Designed ggplot2 visualizations to present insights on improving customer engagement and reducing churn.

### 4. **Analyzing Wrongful Conviction Trends in the Northeast**
   **Duration**: January 2022 - May 2024  
   **Technologies Used**: R (data cleaning, statistical modeling, data visualization)  
   **Overview**:  
   Cleaned and transformed the National Registry of Exonerations dataset. Applied statistical models in RStudio and created visualizations to inform policy recommendations on wrongful convictions.
